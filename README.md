Enhance the uploaded image by adding photorealistic details: incorporate subtle skin textures including visible pores, fine wrinkles around the eyes and mouth, minor blemishes, freckles, and natural skin variations like slight redness in cheeks or oily sheen; introduce slight facial asymmetry for authenticity; apply realistic lighting with soft shadows, highlights, and catchlights in the eyes; add stray hairs, fine facial hair, and fabric wrinkles on clothing; use depth of field with minor background blur; upscale to high resolution while preserving original composition, style: photorealistic DSLR photo, no over-smoothing.# human_like
